#### DESCRIPTION:
**TODO**: Before running the program `python budget.py` make sure that you have the libraries installed which has been mentioned in `requirements.txt`. After that run the command `python budget.py`

**PURPOSE**: The purpose of creating this project is to give the user, some kind of a summary of their spendings. The BudgetApp is helpful for those who are interested to `visualize` how much of money they spent in different things. Users who are interested to have a some kind of visualization of their monthly spending or may be their yearly spendings or even for a weekly spendings need to manually enter the valsues in a spreadsheet program like `Microsoft excel` or `Google sheet` .But with this program they dont need to enter the values manually into the table instead the program will ask the user for the `Budget amount` and `Description,Amount`. After successfully entering the Budget amount and the Description,Amount the user will be asked for the `Get Detailed Summary` which takes input either `1 or 0` and based on that the program automatically creats a table as well as a `BarChart` with some additional details to give the user a nice `visualization` and a `Summary of their spending`. 

**INPUTS**: The budgetapp takes the following inputs as mentioned: 

1. `Budget Amount`: The budget amount is basically the amount which you have spent in a shopping or in a vacation trip or in a special event like marriage , birthday celebration , or marketing. 
In this program it expects for an integer like 1000 or 100000. 
`PLease not that the program expect values in ex1's  way and not ex2's way`.

        `=> ex1 correct way: 1000, 2000, 100, 999,`.

        `=> ex2 wrong way : 1,00,000 , 2,000, 1,00`.

2. `Description,amount`: Description,amount requires only two comma separated input. One part for the description and the other is for amount. The Description part expects an english word or sentence, where the amount part expects a number with out any currancy symbol along with it. 

    Example: 
    
        Description,amount: movie,100
        Description,amount: food,20
        Description,amount: cloths,150

    Note:
        
        AFTER ENTERING ALL THEITEMS OF YOUR LIST IF THE PROGRAM STILL PROMTS YOU FOR Description,amount JUST HIT ENTER WITHOUT ENTERING ANYTHING.

3. `Get Detailed Summary(1/0)`: The Get Deatied Summary expects `1 or 0`. `1` basically represents yes and `0` basically represents no. If you need a detailed summary just enter `1` and if you dont need a detailed summary just enter `0`.
